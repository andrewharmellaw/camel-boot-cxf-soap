# camel-boot-cxf-soap
A seed-project for starting new CXF-based SOAP-API Camel/Spring Boot projects.

This project is to be used to kick-start Camel/Spring-Boot projects (e.g. microservices) which expose a SOAP API.  When used in conjunction with camel-boot (which does the same thing but exposes REST APIs) you have a good starter for ten for most microservices you may want to create.

# Acknowledgements
The idea for these projects was pretty much stolen from Netflix's [Karyon](https://github.com/Netflix/karyon).  It then evolved as we built more and more Microservice-based solutions at Capgemini.  

There is little original thought in all that has been pulled together here - we're just sharing the glue, and the build files, and some examples which illustrate best practices.  The core is based on:
 1. Apache Camel
 1. Spring-Boot
 1. Netflix Archaius and Hystrix
 1. CodaHale Metrics
